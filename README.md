# Analysis of Stream Water Ion Concentrations and Fluxes

### Project Description

This repository aims to calculate the 9-week moving average of stream water
concentrations in four watersheds of Puerto Rico after the hurricane disturbance, Hurricane Hugo, in 1989. The scripts contain the code to reproduce Figure 3 (Schaefer et al., page 199, 2000).
